    This does the following:
        1) Downloads a list of neighbors.
        2) Downloads sequences of those neighbors.
        3) Curates the sequences.
        4) Clusters the unaligned sequences.
        5) Aligns the sequences, with one alignment per cluster.

    Args:
        taxid: taxonomic ID from NCBI, for which to download
            sequences
        segment: only use sequences of this segment (ignored if set
            to '' or None, e.g., if taxid is unsegmented)
        ref_accs: list of accessions of reference sequences to use for curation
        out: path to directory in which write FASTA files of aligned
            sequences (one per cluster)
        aln_memoizer: AlignmentMemoizer to use for memoizing alignments;
            or None to not memoize
        aln_stat_memoizer: AlignmentStatMemoizer to use for memoization
            of alignment statistic values; or None to not memoize
        sample_seqs: fetch all accessions, and then randomly select
            SAMPLE_SEQS of them with replacement and design from
            these; if None (default), do not sample the input
        filter_warn: raise a warning if the fraction of sequences that
            are filtered out during curation is greater than or equal to
            this float
        min_seq_len: toss any sequences whose length is less than
            this. The value should be at least as largest as the
            number of hash values used to produce a sequence signature
            for clustering (in cluster.cluster_with_minhash_signatures());
            otherwise, that function will be unable to form a signature
        min_cluster_size: toss all sequences from any clusters with
            less than this number of sequences; in other words, ignore
            clusters less than this size
        prep_influenza: if True, assume taxid represents an Influenza
            A or B virus taxonomy, and fetch sequences using NCBI's
            Influenza database
        years_tsv: if set, a path to a TSV file to which this will write
            a year (column 2) for each sequence written to out (column 1);
            this is only done for influenza sequences (if prep_influenza
            is True)
        annotation_tsv: if set, a prefix to a TSV file to which this will write
            genomic annotations on a per cluster basis, if there is a reference
            sequence in that cluster
        cluster_threshold: maximum inter-cluster distance to merge clusters, in
            average nucleotide dissimilarity (1-ANI, where ANI is
            average nucleotide identity); higher results in fewer
            clusters
        accessions_to_use: if set, a collection of accessions to use instead
            of fetching neighbors for taxid
        sequences_to_use: if set, a dict of sequences to use instead of
            fetching them for taxid; note that this does not perform
            curation on these sequences
        meta_filt: tuple of 2 dictionaries where the keys are any of 'country', 'year',
            'entry_create_year', 'taxid' and values for the first are a collection 
            of what to include or True to indicate that the metadata must exist and
            the second are what to exclude.
        meta_filt_against: tuple of 2 dictionaries where the keys are any of 'country', 
            'year', 'entry_create_year', 'taxid' and values for the first are a
