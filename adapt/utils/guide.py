    As in seq_mismatches(..), this considers 'N' with any other base to
    be a mismatch.

    This also tolerates G-U base pairing:
    An RNA guide with U can bind to target RNA with G, and vice-versa.
    Note that a guide sequence that ends up being synthesized to RNA
    is the reverse-complement of the guide sequence constructed here, so
    that it will hybridize to the target (here, the guide sequences
    are designed to match the target). If the RNA guide were to have U and
    the RNA target were to have G, then the guide sequence here would be
    A and the target would be G. If the RNA guide were to have G
    and the RNA target were to have U, then the guide sequence here were
    would be C and the target would be T. Thus, to allow G-U pairing,
    we count a base X in the guide sequence as matching a base Y in
    the target if either of the following is true:
      - X == 'A' and Y == 'G'
      - X == 'C' and Y == 'T'

    Unlike in seq_mismatches(..), it is important to know which sequence
    here represents the guide and which represents the target, so we
    cannot just refer to them interchangeably as seq_a and seq_b.

    This tolerates ambiguity and decides whether a guide binds based on
    whether its number of mismatches with the target sequence is within
    a threshold.

    If the target sequence contains a gap (and the guide sequence does
    not, as it should not), this decides that the guide does not bind.

    The calls to seq_mismatches() or seq_mismatches_with_gu_pairs() may
    be slow because they sum over all bases in guide_seq and target_seq;
    in particular, the lookups in FASTA_CODES may take a while for each
    term in the sum. In many cases, the output of those functions (i.e.,
    the number of mismatches between guide_seq and target_seq) will be
    far higher than the given threshold on mismatches. The guide will not
    bind, but we can determine this without having to sum over all bases.
    To speed up these cases (i.e., when guide_seq and target_seq are very
    different), this function calls seq_mismatches() (or
    seq_mismatches_with_gu_pairs()) on just a substring of guide_seq
    and target_seq. The substring is arbitrary: here, it is taken from
    the start of those sequences. If the number of mismatches between
    those substrings is already too high, we can terminate early and
    say that the guide does not bind.
